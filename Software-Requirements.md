# Software Requirements

## Vision
To create an engaging, fun, and high-tech Android app that enables users to create custom games of Tag with their friends.

## Scope (In/Out)

* Notifications when users are tagged
* A map view of the game players

### Out
Our app will not provide the following functionality in the MVP:
* This app will never hold personal biometrics such as facial recognition on our server
* This app will never devulge a user's location to members not in the current game group
* This app will never sell a user's location to outside vendors

## MVP
Our MVP will include:
* At least two total players (one other player) 
* Possible tag definitions, may change as we go:
    * By distance
    * By QR Code 
    * By taking a picture of them
    * By facial recognition 
* Tag notifications

## Stretch
Our stretch goals include:
* Showing multiple players on a map
* Geo fence (bounds)
* Control who can see the game by using authentication
* Bread crumbs
* Power ups
* Themed games
* Ability to have multiple games running
* Ability to customize who is invited to a game
* Customize notifications when tagged
* Have a stats page that shows metrics including how far user has walked, how many times user has been tagged
* Bonus items to find or purchase that give you extra powers like improved visibility, increased frequency of location updates, cloaking
* Monetization

## Functional Requirements
Functional requirements of our MVP include:
1.	A user can view the location of all members in the current game group
2.	A user be notified when they have been tagged and when they have tagged someone else
3.	A user can log in and log out
4. A user's map view will follow their movement during the game

## Non-Functional Requirements
Non-Functional requirements of our MVP include:
1.	A userâ€™s password will be protected using Amplify Cognito
2. The app will be tested using Espresso

## Data Flow 
A user opens the app and signs in. The app pings their location at the point of sign in at a lower frequency than during active games. The app will display active games within a certain distance of the user's location as options to join an active game. The user will also have the option to create a new game instance for others nearby to join. Once the user is in an active game the app will ping their location at a defined frequency. The game starts with one person who is 'it'. Other users they tag also become 'it'. Those who are tagged mark themselves as tagged using the 'I got tagged' button. Games end when when all the users in the game instance have been tagged. The user can leave a game early by signing out of the app. Location pinging ceases when the game ends or the user signs out of the app.
